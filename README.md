Whyalla’s 150 Ton Crane

Recently completed at the Ship-yard and a landmark for many miles around is Whyalla’s 150-ton crane, which has been built at the east end of the fitting-out wharf to enable heavy lifts, such as complete engines, to be placed directly into ships under construction or repair. 
The crane is the largest of its type in Australia and, as far as is known, probably the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. A few cranes in this country have a bigger lifting capacity, for example, a floating crane in one of the eastern States is designed to lift 175 tons, and there is an overhead travelling crane of 225 tons capacity in the Open Hearth building at the Australian Iron and Steel Company’s Works at Port Kembla. 
As is usual for cranes and other lifting devices, the Whyalla crane was tested with a 25 p.c. overload, making a total lift of 187½ tons, this weight being made up with steel rails packed together in a specially constructed cradle.

Most Whyalla residents have already observed that the crane is of the fixed tower, revolving cantilever type. A few details of its construction may be of interest. The tower is about 105 feet high above wharf level and carries on its top a machined circular path 35 feet in diameter around which are arranged 75 rollers, which support another roller path in two sections fastened to the underside of the revolving upper structure, the whole arrangement being similar to a very large roller bearing. 
On the centre of the roller path assembly and fastened to the tower is a massive kingpin weighing about six tons. This kingpin is only for the purpose of centralising the revolving boom and has no part in preventing the boom from overturning, as the crane is so designed that under all conditions of load it is stable without any assistance from the kingpin. This is arranged by balancing the revolving portion by means of ballasting at the rear end, and 52 tons of pig iron were placed in the ballast box for this purpose. The ballast box is at the back end of the crane under the machinery house. 
The top of the machinery house is about 160 feet above wharf level. 

The crane is designed to lift its full rated load (150 tons) up to 85 feet from its centre, and progressively decreasing loads down to 45 tons when the trolley and hoist assembly are at their maximum radius of 126 feet. 
All motions are operated electrically from the driver’s cabin, and the power supply is obtained through the crane’s own substation at the base of the tower. 

The trolley, which travels on four rails on top of the boom to allow lifts to be taken at or travelled to the desired radius, carries a main hoist for the 150 ton load and an auxiliary hoist for loads up to 25 tons. 

Two speeds are available for each of the hoist motions, the main hoist in low gear being designed to lift or lower at 10 feet per minute and the auxiliary hoist in top gear at 60 feet per minute. The trolley can travel in or out with the load at 50 feet a minute, and the crane, when revolving, makes a full turn in six minutes. 
The two hoist motions and the trolley travel are operated by wire ropes from three winches in the machinery house and there is a 10 ton overhead travelling crane in- side the house in case any of the winch machinery needs to be dismantled and lowered to the wharf for repairs. 
Not the least interesting part of the job was the construction of the foundation. This contains 2,400 cubic yards of reinforced concrete weighing about 4,300 tons, and with the added weight of the crane itself (900 tons), the ground at the bottom of the foundation has to bear a total load of approximately 5,000 tons. 
Preliminary borings proved the existence of a hard clay which would safely bear the required load, and although concrete piles were provided for in case the clay surface was not suitable when exposed, they were not required. 

As the foundation was located at the end of the fitting-out wharf where the harbor had previously been dredged to 27 feet below low water it was built inside a circular cofferdam formed with interlocking steel sheet piling and supported from collapse from the out- side water pressure by means of reinforced concrete rings. These rings were made above water and lowered through the water to their correct position on long bolts. The weight of each ring was about 220 tons. 
The cofferdam was pumped out progressively after the placing and wedging of each supporting ring, and when dry except for a little leakage easily handled by pumping, excavation was commenced on the floor of the dam. 

The final level for the bottom of the foundation was 33 feet below low water, and thus at extreme tides men were at work over 40 feet below the harbor water level. 

During the whole construction period no serious accident of any kind occurred, and in every way the job is a lasting credit to all the Whyalla workmen who were engaged on it.
